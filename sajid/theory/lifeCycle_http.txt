Life cycle of HTTP:
---------------------
1) You enter a url and press enter
2) The browser check in its browser dns for ip for that domain.
3) If it does not find it check in router dns
4) If not then it find in ISP dns
5) If it does not find in ISP it do the recurrsive search if it find it return to browser with IP or it give host not find.

6) Once Browser finds the IP it initiate the TCP connection.
7) Browser send syn packet to server
8) The server accpet the request and in return send ACK packet to client.
