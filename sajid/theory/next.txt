What is next in express?

>> Next is function which is passed as a callback argument toa route.Whenever next function is called, It finish the current middleware function and execute the next middleware function.

example.

var myLogger = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('LOGGED')
  next()
}

app.use(myLogger);

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(3000)

Whenever a url is called a middleware will be executed and next is called. So the execution will go in next middleware function that is callback function and will send hello world to user.
