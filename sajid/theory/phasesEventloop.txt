As we are aware that complete code is executed first by event loop and if required it assign work to thread pool.


Below are the phase of event loop.

1) poll
2) check
3) close callback
4) timers
5) pending callback
6) idle, prepare.


Main phase out of this poll,check,timers

poll phase:
--------------

POLL Phase handles all the input/output operations.
All the synchronos javascript code are executed in poll phase.

Example 1:
---------

console.log('first');
console.log('second');

All the above code will executed when the event loop is poll phase.

Example 2:
----------

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('2');
});
console.log('1');

1) So when eventloop encounter above code. This code is first executed in poll phase.

a) It execute setTimeout and regiester callback  to callback queue of timer phase by node.js API
b) print 1


2) So event loop after poll phase completion it goes one by one and reach to time phase.


3) As soon as it reach timer phase. The event loop execute the code in timer queue.And it print 2 on console.

4) The timer phase use FIFO queuing mechanism to queue multiple callbacks, to be executed in single iteration of eventloop
