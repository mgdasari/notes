Need of microservice architechure?
------------------------------------

Monolithic:
------------
1) EArlier this architechure used to be followed.
2) If any bug was founc whole code base needs to be deployed.
3) And if there is cluster production environment then the code needs to be deployed in all the cluster.
4) This lead to nightmare and very difficult job to manage.

To overcome difficulties of Monolithic architechire microservice architechire came into picture.

Microservice:
----------------
1) In this distributed system is involved.
2) In these large code base is dictributed in to small services.
3) small team can focus on small task and services.
4) Every service is independent and communicate with each other.
5****) The most important part is if you want to add/delete any services It can be easilt done in microservice.But very difficult to manage in Monolithic.
6) We can add the main service behind the API gateway. In these we give URL to client.
The client call these service,,api gateway in turn call actual bussines services.
7) Maintainbility become easy.
