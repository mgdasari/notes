What is encryption?

>> encryption is a process with the help of which we convert the data from plain text formate to unreadbale formate.

It has 2 type symmetric and Asymettric:

1) If you use same key for encryption and decryption then it is symmetric
2) If you use different key for encryption and decryption then it is Asymettric.

So while sotriing data in db use encrytion to store as it need to decrypted and validate.If you hash then it wont be possible to bring back to normal state.
