what is object prototype?
-------------------------

>>
1) All objects in javascript inherit the properties from a prototype.

Examples:
---------
1) Date object inherit properties and methods from Date prototype.
2) Math object inherit properties and methods from Math prototype.
3) Array object inherit properties and methods from Array prototype.

**)Prototype allow us to use properties and methods "ON" an object even if that properties and methods are not part of that object

Examples:
---------
1) 
var arr=[];
arr.push(2);
console.log(arr); //2 here we have not defined .push method in the arr object but still we are able to use it. As this method is a part of array prototype

Note:
-------

The javascript try find a push method in the array arr but it dose not find it. So it checks in array prototype and find the method.
