Q) What is Javascript?

>>
1) It is a programming laganguage.
2) It is used for client and server side application developement.
3) Javascript is single threaded laganguage and it is synchronous(Execute line by line and wait till current task is finsihed).
4) We have Javascript as a standard, implemented as engine by different company like V8 engine,spidermonkey,
etc. These engine basically convert javascript code into machine code.


Q) how do we get asynchronous code with Javascript then?

>>
1) Javascript engine have web api that handles the task in background.
2) THe call stack recognize the function of web api and hands them off to be handle by browser.
Once this task are finsihed they return and are pushed onto the callstack as callback.



Example:
-------
console.log("first")
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("second")
}, 1000)
console.log("third")

Explanation:
------------

1) When you run the above code. 
2) First Initialization happens.
3) Secondly the execution happens.

In these,
1) A callstack is formed and each line is executed in that.
2) Here line22 will be executed.
3) Then set timeout webapi is called and execution moves to line 26.
4) Once the time is over i.e 1000 then event loop checks the main stack is empty or not.Once all the line is executed.
The event loop push the callback to main stack and that is code is executed.

So output of the above is code is as follow:
---------------------------------------------

first
third
second

Note:
------

1) In node.js we have libuv library because of which it help node.js to achieve asynchronality while in javascript its web api which help it to achieve asynchronality.
