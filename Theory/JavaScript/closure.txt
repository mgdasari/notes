What is closure ?
-----------------

1) closure is an ability of a function to remember the variable and function that are declared in its out scope.
2) whenever a function is created a closure is also created.

3)Javascript has a lexical scope.
4) lexical scoping means that variable defined outside scope are automatically available inside the scope.which means you dont need to pass teh variable explicitly.


Example:
-----------
1)

/**
 *Lexical scoping is explained below. The variable defined outside scope are available inside the scope.You dont have to pass explicilty. 
 */

let i = 2;

const test = () =>{
    console.log(i);  //2
}

test()


2)
/**
 * Let understand how child function can access the variable and argument of the outer function.
 */

function outerFunction(b){
    let x=10;
    function innerFunction(){
        console.log(x);   //10
        console.log(b);    //5
    }
    return innerFunction;
}

outerFunction(5)();

3) 
/**
 * childfunction can access the variable defined in outer scope even when outer funtion is executed completly.
 */

function outerFunction1(){
    let parentVariable = 1000;
    function childfunction1(){
        console.log(parentVariable);
    }
    return childfunction1
}

let executable = outerFunction1();
/**
 * Here outer funtion is executed and return child function.And child function still access the outer variable.This called closure.
 */
executable()

NOTE:
------

1) CLosure keep the state of the outer variable between the multiple call.Innr function dose not contain separate copy it just keep the refference of the outer variable.

function ParentFunction() {

    var parentVariable = 60;

    function ChildFunction() {
        return parentVariable += 1;
    }

    return ChildFunction;
}

var executeChild = ParentFunction();
console.log(executeChild()); //61
console.log(executeChild()); //62
console.log(executeChild()); //63
console.log(executeChild()); //64


**)when to use closure?
------------------------

If you want in your project few implementation should be hided.
closure can be useful in creating private variable and function
