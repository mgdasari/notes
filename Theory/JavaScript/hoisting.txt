Hoisting:
---------
>>

1) Hoisting is the default behaviour of the Javascript where all the variable and function declaration are moved at the top of the code.

It basically refers to the process in which variable and function declaration are allocated a memory prior to the execution of the code.

2) Declaration made using var are initialized as undefined and dunction declared as regualar function are initialized with function only.

3) let and const are hoisted but not as var.It is hoisted in temporal dead zone.

Temporal Dead Zone:
--------------------
1) 

example:
--------

1)  variable Hoisting
---------------------------

console.log(a); //undefined
    a=1;
    var a;

2) Regular function Hoisting:
------------------------------

hoisted() //hoisted function

function hoisted(){
    console.log('hoisted function');
}
