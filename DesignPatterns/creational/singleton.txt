Singleton design pattern is a type of Creational design pattern.

Singleton design pattern is used when u want to have only one object of a class needs to be created.

example: 

1) Suppose there are 3 objects. ObjectA, ObjectB, Objectc
2) his objects are refferenced to single instance of a object
3) This single instance is responsible for calling underlying methods.

Where to use:
-----------

Suppose you want particular object to be used throughout  the project. So you wont create a object everytime in each file. So better create a sinhle instance and use it where it is required.
