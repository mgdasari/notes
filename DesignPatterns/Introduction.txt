What are design pattern?
--------------------------
>>
1) Design pattern are solution to the problem we encounter every day of programming.
2) They basically help in solving problems related to object generation and integrations.
3) Design pattern act as a template which we apply to solve the problems.


History of Design pattern?
----------------------------
1) The four authors of the books Elements of reusable Object oriented software are reffered as Gang of fours.
2) explains the 23 classic design pattern which has changed the software development life cycle.


Types of Design pattern:
-------------------------
1) Creational:
----------------

This type deal with object creation and initialization. This pattern give program more flexibility in deciding which object needs to be created for a given case.

Eg: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory.


2) Structural:
--------------
This type deal with object and clases composition.
This pattern deal with decoupling interfaces and implementing clases and its objects.

Eg:Adapter,Brideg etc..

3) Behavioural:
------------------
This type deal with communication between object and classes.

Eg: Command,chain of responsibility,Interpreter etc


Pre-requities:
----------------

Understanding of Object oriented concept like Abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation. Knowledge of classes, Interfaces and Abstract clasess will be helpful.
