Q) What is JWT  token ?

>> 
1) JWT is a open standard RFC standard 7519. It securely transfer information between 2 bodies.
2) JWT token is used for authentication and it is self contained information about the users.

USes:
-------
1) authentication 
2) Transfer information

Structure:
----------
aaaaaaa.bbbbbbbb.cccccccc
header.payload.signature

Header: Header is formed by base 64 encoding of below json.
-------

{
alg:algorithm like hmac sha 256 or rsa 
type:type of token
}

payload: Payload is formed by base 64 encoding of below json
---------

{
claims basically user details or meta data 
}

Reserverd claims:
--------------------
iss (issuer): Issuer of the JWT

sub (subject): Subject of the JWT (the user)

aud (audience): Recipient for which the JWT is intended

exp (expiration time): Time after which the JWT expires

nbf (not before time): Time before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing

iat (issued at time): Time at which the JWT was issued; can be used to determine age of the JWT

jti (JWT ID): Unique identifier; can be used to prevent the JWT from being replayed (allows a token to be used only once)

Signature: HMAC SHA 256 OF HEADER AND PAYLOAD
----------- 

HMACSHA256(HADER+'.'+PAYLOAD),SECRET)


Example:

JWT Token:
-----------

eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.w2RTnDPj7gWRyr1UF2y49jEuV2iBLkdt_jKCxFnowtA


header:
----------

{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

body:
------
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022
}

signature:
-------------
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),12345678900000000000
)
