Q) what is apache cassandra?
>>apache cassandra is free and open source nosql database used for managing large amountof data.Prociding high availibity with no single point of failure.

Q) what are the feature of cassandra?
>>1) Efficient write
2) Ha 
3) cassandra query language.
4) easy data distribution.

Q) different type of data model?

>> conceptual data model
logical data model
physical data model.


Q) what is dofference between cassandra and RDBMS?
>>cassandra:
-------------

1) Master less (no single point of failure)
2) ALways on continous availibity
3) Supports dynamic,structured and unstructured data.
4) Big data 


RDBMS:
------
1) mASTER SLAVE REPLICATION 
2) General REPLICATION with Master SLAVE
3) support structred data.
4)

Q) what are four main element of database?
>> 
cluster
keyspace
column family
cql table.

Q) what is cqlsh?
>> cqlsh is query language used to communicate with its database.

It is used ti create schema
insert data and update
execute the query

Q) what is yaml file in cassandra?
>> If you want to change anything in database u need to do changes in yaml and take restart.

Q) What  is cluster in cassandra?
>>
1) cluster is outermost structure in cassandra.
2) cassandra assign data to node of cluster by arranging them in ring.
3) Node hold replica of different range of data.

Q) What are keyspace in cassandra?
>>keyspace is outermost container in cassandra.keyspace is used to group a column families togeteher.

Q) how to create keyspace in cassandra?
>>create keyspace mukund with replication ={'class':'simpleStrategy','replication_factor':'3'}
and durable_write='true'

Q) what are durable writes?
>>Durable write provide instruction to cassandra whether to use commitlog for update on the current keyspace or not.

Q) What is replication factor?
>>The replication factor refers to number of nodes that will act as a copies of data.

Q) what do you mean by replication strategy ?

>>
1) replication strategy means how the replica are placed inside the node of the rings.
2) replication strategy determine which node will get copies of which keys.

There are 2 different type of strategy,

1) simple strategy ---IT is used for development environment
2) network topology strategy.-- It is used for production environment.


Q) What is row in cassandra ? what are different element in it?

>>1) A row is collection of column. 
2) It is a small unit which stores a related data.

The different element/part of row are.

1) row key
2) coulmn key
3) column value.

Q) What is primary key?

>>The primary key is a key which is used to unique identify the row.

There are 3 type of key;

1) primary key
2) compound primary key
3) composite partioning key

Q)What is primary key

>>There is only single column as a primary key.The column is also called as partioning key.

Q) what is compound primary key
>>Here one key is partioning key and remaining other are clustering key.THe clustering key is used to sort data in partioning.

Q) what  is composite partioning key
>>It is use to create multiple partition for the data.

Q) Difference between drop and truncate ?
>> DRop is used to delete complete table and truncate is use to delete only data from a particular table.

Q) How does cassandra perform write operation.

>> 
1) Whenever a write request comes it logs in commit logs then data will be captured and stored in mem-table.
2) when mem-table is fulled the data is flushed to sstable 
3) All write are automatically partitioned and replicated throughout the cluster.


Q) explain the terms memetable,commitlog and sstable
>>
1) commit log-- The commit logs are like crash recovery mechanism that support cassandra to achieve future goals.
2) mem-table -- mem table is in memory data structure that corresponds to CQL table.
3) sstable --The content of mem table are flushed to files called as stables.

Q) what is the use of coordinator nodes.
>> Read operation are easy because client can connect to any nodes in a cluster. If a client connect to node and it does not have data it trying too read. Then that node is coordinator.

Q) how dose read operation happens in cassandra
>>

Q) what do you mean by compaction.
Q) explain nodetool util
