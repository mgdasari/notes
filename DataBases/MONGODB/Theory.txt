Q) What is difference between RDBMS and No-sql?
------------------------------------------------

RDBMS:
------
1) It is a relational database management system.
2) It has pre defined schema.
3) It is used when you have structed data.
4) It is table based database.


NoSQL:
------

1) It is a non relational database.
2) It does not have pre defined schema.
3) It is used for both structed(cassandra) and unstructed(monodb) data.
4) It is document oriented database.

Q) Different type of NoSQL database?
------------------------------------------
>>
1) key value based ---redis
2) document based --mongodb
3) graph based --graphql
4) column based --cassandra

Q) what is mongodb?
>> mongodb is document oriented database.It store data in BSON formate.It provide high scalibility, availibility and performance

Q) What is mongod?
>>mongod is used to start a mongo db database.

Q) what is mongo?
>>mongo is used to connect to mongod. You can also use python javascript to connect to mongodb.

Q) Why/ Advantages of mongodb?

>>
1) It is document oriented database.
2) You can apply indexes on multiple flieds.
3) It is schema less
4) Auto sharding is available.
5) Replication is available due to which it provide high availibility

Q) Data modeling in mongodb?

>> There is 2 type of model in mongodb.
1) Normalized
2) DeNormalized

1) Normalized:
---------------
a) In these subdocument is mentioned in main document by refferences.

where to use Normalized Data model:
-----------------------------------
a) If you want less redundant data so that memory can be used efficiently.Then go for mongodb.
b) If your application insert update and delete operation more then read then Normalized is better option.

Example:
-----------
Employee (main document):
--------------------------

{_id:<objid101>,
EmpId: "10025AE336"
}

personal (subdocument):
--------------------------

{
    _id:<objid102>,
    empDocId:"objid101",
    FirstName:"Radhika",
    Lastname:"sharma"

}

contacts(subdocument):
-----------------------
{
    _id:<objid103>,
    empDocId:"objid101",
    number:7021829703
}

2) Denormalized:
-----------------

a) In these all teh subdocument are mentioned in the main document.

where to use Denormalized Data model:
-----------------------------------
1) If you have read operation much more than insert/update/delete then go for Denormalized.
2) Having redundant and memory efficiency is not major concern.

Example:
----------
{
	_id: ,
	Emp_ID: "10025AE336"
	Personal_details:{
		First_Name: "Radhika",
		Last_Name: "Sharma",
		Date_Of_Birth: "1995-09-26"
	},
	Contact: {
		e-mail: "radhika_sharma.123@gmail.com",
		phone: "9848022338"
	},
	Address: {
		city: "Hyderabad",
		Area: "Madapur",
		State: "Telangana"
	}
}


Q) Projections:
----------------
1) If suppose in document there are many document but you want few fields in output. Then Projections are used.

Query:
------

db.collectionName.find({},{field1:1,field2:1,field3:3})

It will display the result with field1 field2 field3

Q) Pretty():
------------
It use to formate the output data .

Query:
------

db.collectionName.find().pretty()

Q) LIMIT():
-----------
LIMIT function is same as limit in sql.

Query:
-----

db.collectionName.find().limit(5);

select * from tableName limit 5;

Q) Aggregation:
-----------------

1) In Aggregation we basically group the document and perform mathematical operation on it.
2) Aggregate operation like average,min,max,count
3) It has pipeline concept attach to it.

pipeline=[{{$match:{}},{$group:{}},{$project:{}}}]

Q) How replication works ?
>> All the client who makes changes goes to primary node and updates are pushed to replica set which are connected to primary node

Q)What is sharding?
--------------------
1) Vertical scaling : 
----------------------
Suppose you want to support a 100 million data record. So you use 8gb ram,100 gb disk and 4 cpu Now if you want to support 100 million more then you add up the resources 8gb ram,100 gb disk and 4 cpu. This is called as Vertical scaling.

2) Horizontal scaling(sharding):
---------------------------------
Suppose you want to support a 100 million data record. So you use 8gb ram,100 gb disk and 4 cpu Now if you want to support 100 million, Then you create a group of data let say 50 million data and store in on shard or serve with 4gb ram,50 gb disk and 2 cpu like wise we will use 4 shard to support 200 million data.

The data is divide in range with keys.

Some basic commands.
--------------------
1) mongod ----To start a mongo db
2) mongo ---to connect to mongod
3) show dbs --It will show databases.
4) use dbs -- It will select the database.
5) use mukund -- If this database is not present. Then it will create a database name mukund.
6) mukund.text -- It will create a collection.
7) db.text.insert() -- It will insert documment in the collection.
8) db.items.insertOne({name:"sony es30",price:13000,stock:33})---It wiill create a collections and insert the data in it with unique objectId.
9) db.item.find({price:13000}) --It will return a document whose price is equal to 13000.
10) db.items.deleteOne({price:13000}) ---It will delete first oject of item with price 13000.
11) db.createCollection('mukund');
12) db.items.updateOne({name:mukund},{$set:{price:20}});
13) db.items.drop()
And command:
---------------
db.item.finc({},{})

db.item.find({price:{$gte:13000}},{stock:{$gte:33}})

Or command:
------------
db.item.finc($or:[{},{}])
db.item.find($or:[{price:{$gte:13000}},{stock:{$gte:33}}])

Q) Profiler:
------------
It is used to monitor a queries.

Q) Journalism:
------------------

It is used to take safe back up.

Q) What are indexes in mongodb?
>>indexes are special structure in mongodb which stores data in easy to traverse form.

Q) What is grid in mongodb?
>> Grid in mongodb is used for storing large file like images and all.

Q) Does mongodb has primary and foriegn key?
>>> By default  mongodb do not have primary and foriegn key.But you can achieve by embedding one document into other.
