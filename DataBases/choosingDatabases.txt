Which to choose RDBMS OR NoSQL:
--------------------------------

It all depend on the requirement.

RDBMS:
---------

1) Suppose your project have fixed schema, have limited data count, required ACID Property then you should go for MYSQL.

2) In mysql you can not do horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling only possible which means you have to increase a resource capacity.

Not like nosql you can have multi site architechure.

LIKE BANKING systems. In thses you have fixed schema, not million user, you acid property so MYSQL is used.

NoSQL:
------
1) Suppose YOU have a system where schema is dynamic chaning and you have to support huge data. But you dont have major concern for ACID propert.

As you have to support huge data then you may require multi site set up.

2) In these you go for NoSQL.

Example e-commerce the schema varies for each product.


ACID propert:
--------------

How to handle one transaction is governed by acid property

Atomic
correctness
Isolation
Durability 

ACID is property/feature impelemented and followed by RDBMS by itself you dont have to do extra things for it.

NoSQL:
-------

1) NoSQL means not only sql which means its alternative to rdbms which does not require fixed schema.

2) It majorly scale horizontally and major operation on data.

3) nosql data base can also be used for storing structured data and can work as rdbms. To be specific functionality like mysql is subset of NoSQL.

Need of NoSQL data BASE:
----------------------------

1) Provide more Scalibility 
2) Perform superiror performance.
3) schema less data model.
4) nosql per node give high performance then rdbms nodes.
