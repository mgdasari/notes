IDAM CODE flow:

1) From server file flow go to router.js where url is validated.
2) From router.js to controller.js
3) From controller.js for headerValidations a headerValidations.js is created and in this all the header fields are validated,For each field a function is written.After all check a boolean or error is thrown if there is an error.
4) After header validation a controll comes back to controller.js and then goes to requestMapper.js where existense of field checkked and a getter setter  is done to create a this object which has all the field and functions.It return an this object if there is error it throws and error.
5) Now the execution again comes back to controller and it goes to field level validation.Here for each field a validation is applied (null,xssr,astrik check) and a mandatory field validation is applied.Once the validation is done the flow again comes to controller.
6) Now the 
7) In this we have majorly we have _this = this and _req = req and _res= res this we have done for variable scoping.

Which means a variable will not have accessed outside the functions like in process.on() and to do this we have used variable scoping technic
