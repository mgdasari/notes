Introduction:
-------------

Usually we have 3 tier archieture.

1) Presentattion Tier: User Interface
2) Application Tier: Bussiness logic
3) Data tier: Data queries and interaction.

Each of these tier can be maintained and worked independently.And in most case there are in different host.
Therefore a Application queries are limited to the network performannce.Data retrival time play key role in user experince and is critical requirment in almost all Application.

What is caching and how it work?
-------------------------------

1) Caching is buffering technique which stores frequestly queried data in temorary memory.
2) It make data easier to accessed and reduces the work load from database.

Example.:
---------
First time it store into temporary location and retrive data from it every time.

3) The cache can be set up in different tiers or on its own, depending on the use case.

Benefits:
------------
1) performannce
2) scalibilty
3) availability.
