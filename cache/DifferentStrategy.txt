Strategy is use to determine the relation between the DATA SORUCE, CACHING SYSTEM and HOW YOUR DATA CAN BE accessed.

There are various technic which can impact your perfomance.

So before archetecting you should go through the data to be accessed so that you determine the Strategy.

Different Strategy:

1) cache aside: read from cache if not present query to db and store to cache.
2) read through: Application layer will always read from cache and cache will get update from database.
3) write through: Application will write to cache and cache will update the database.
4) write back: It is same like write through but it write to database once in while.
5) write around: Application write data to db but read the data from cache. If not present in cache it go to db.



Best of above is cache aside.

Because:

1) Resilient to the database failure.
2) simpler to implement.
3) data model can be different between cache and db.
4) Best for read heavy work load.
